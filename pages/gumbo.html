        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
        <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Roux:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, 
                until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. 
                Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Gumbo:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. 
                    Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                    Remove from heat, and set aside.   
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, 
                    then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. 
                    Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; 
                    remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons 
                    of file gumbo powder just before serving.
                </li>
            </ol>
